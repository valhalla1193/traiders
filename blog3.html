        <h1>Latest news from the cryptocurrency market</h1>
        <h2>Cryptocurrency is getting stronger: should we sell or not?</h2>
        <p>The cryptocurrency market seems to be recoved, but it is still not good yet. The $3,500 BTC price is still good for sell. On leading markets, BTC has continued its long-tirm falling.</p>
       <h2> BITCOIN PRICE CAUSES HIGH LEVEL SELLING?</h2>
        <p>Bitcoin got a sell rating on markets. On itBit, its had high selling level.</p>

        <p>The Bitcoin price was changing across markets, making for arbitrage opportunities not longer then day. There are markets that had price difference almost $100.
                The Bitcoin price strongly recovered from it's minimum of $3,372 and pushed back to $3,500 per one coin.</p>
               
                <h2>ETHEREUM GOT SOME REVANGE</h2>

        <p>At Coinbase, Ethereum got stronger and walked away from a selling mood. Buyers grows the price back up to $5.

Shell we sell crypto currency or it is getting stronger?


Buyers of Ethereum still hope it stays in this range for some time.
They would feel rather comfortable at price between $120 and $150. If it change price like $5 upwards also there is an opportunety that the price can be changed downwards of $30 as well. </p>

<h2>WHAT WILL HAPPEND WITH DASH?</h2>

        <p>Dash is worth much than Bitcoin SV  , which seems to be maintaining some degree of pacing with BSV.
                How long it will remain?
                Dash took back $2 in trading, so now it is about $67. The market movement  makes one Dash stronger in compating to other cryptocurrencies. Will it be strong tendence? We will see in a while.</p>

                <h2>TRX STILL WORTH LESS</h2>
        <p>TRON price expected to be about 3 or 5 cents but it is not strong enough today.</p>
        <p>Dispite of current market situation Tron’s future as a smart contract platform looks bright enough. 
                However, the Tron price still can not cross over the $0.03 for one coin. The reason could be a big amount of TRX: 66,664,206,012. A large amount could lead to problems with growing up. The same effect we can see with Stellar and Ripple too. A lot of people hold large bags, and during jump of prices, they can thow it all on market causes dumping.</p> <p>Though Tron’s future as a smart contract platform seems to be bright according to it's potential and dispite of current market situation.</p>
